<p align="center">As Scurry crossed the finish line both Sally and Chester cheered and clapped for him. They were so incredibly proud of their best friend for not giving up. Scurry initially believed that he had no chance of finishing the race, but his friends encouraged him and supported him and dug deep in the trenches with him until he made it through. As fireworks blazed through the sky, Scurry thought to himself about the valuable lesson he learned through this completely challenging journey: &quot;Never give up on your dreams.&quot;</p>
