<p align="center">The next stage of the race felt like they were travelling in the middle of nowhere. Scurry began to feel like the journey was worthless and ever-lasting.  He really did not see any point in continuing to the finish line anymore. Chester took upon the role of keep Scurry in the race. Chester believed with all his heart that if Scurry could finish this race and achieve his initial goal, he will believe that he could conquer anything and reach all his dreams. So with that idea in mind, they stomped on, crushing grass as the moved, leaving tiny footprints behind.</p>
