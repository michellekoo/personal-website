<p align="center">They finally reached the sandy, cool beach! It was the morning and the sunrise was just peaking over the ocean. It was a truly beautiful sight to be seen. Sally and Chester were estatic that they were almost finished with the race! Scurry felt a sense of relief when he saw the morning daylight. The sun was a symbol of the &quot;light at the end of the tunnel&quot; for all of them. They couldn't wait to reach the finish line!</p>
