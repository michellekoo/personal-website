<p align="center">The day passed by so quickly that before they knew it, it was already pitch-black dark. Scurry was terrified of the dark--&quot;The dark has scary noises and animals and bugs and dangerous vehicles...AHH!&quot; he exclaimed. Chester, being the brave one within the group, decided that he will lead them through the immense darkness. Sally was glad that the moon and stars were out to give them an outline of the city streets. Scurry, because of a long day, was extremely tired and just wanted to curl up in his tree next to his acorns and go to bed. Sally and Chester, being the best friends that they are, refused to let Scurry give up on his dream of finishing the ultimate National Squirrel Race!</p>
