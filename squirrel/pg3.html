<p align="center">The next phase of the race was the extremely hot, sandy desert. Facing both sandstorms and the deathly heat, all the squirrels were burning up under their winter coat of fur. Sally and Chester are still extremely determined to finish the race, while Scurry is beginning to get tired. Regardless of the heat, Scurry made a promise to finish the race and he isn't a squirrel to break his promises!</p>
