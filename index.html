							<p>Hello world!  I am a rising third year computer science major at the University of California, Berkeley.  I have lived in the bay area my entire life and I am from San Ramon, CA.  This past summer I have been interning at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. On campus I am an avid member of UC Berkeley's Society of Women Engineers Corporate Committee and I am the Chief Technology Officer for the Undergraduate Journal of Psychology at Berkeley.  My hobbies include baking, reading, and playing the piano.  I welcome all internship and research opportunities. I hope you enjoy my site! </p>

								<h6> During the summer of 2015, I have been working as a research intern under the supervision of Wucherl Yoo and Alex Sim in the Computational Research Division as part of the <a href="http://science.energy.gov/wdts/suli/">U.S. Department of Energy’s Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship</a> program.  The project I have been working on is motivated by the observations that I/O performance analyses can be conducted from monitored performance measurement data from scientific clusters.  I created an I/O performance analysis framework that helped uncover bottlenecks in the Palomar Transient Factory application by analyzing measurment data recorded on NERSC Edison using Python, Spark, iPython notebook, and Matplotlib. I also created a Darshan parser/tool in Python using Apache Spark that analyzed the HPC computing tools’ I/O logs and calculated performance measurements. From this work, I developed research deliverables, research papers, and scientific posters, that were submitted to SULI and ACM SC '15. </h6>
